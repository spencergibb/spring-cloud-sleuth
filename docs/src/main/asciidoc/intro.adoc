Spring Cloud Sleuth implements a distributed tracing solution for http://cloud.spring.io[Spring Cloud].

=== Terminology

Spring Cloud Sleuth borrows http://research.google.com/pubs/pub36356.html[Dapper's] terminology.

*Span:* The basic unit of work. For example, sending an RPC is a new span, as is sending a response to an
RPC. Span's are identified by a unique 64-bit ID for the span and another 64-bit ID for the trace the span
is a part of.  Spans also have other data, such as descriptions, timestamped events, key-value
annotations (tags), the ID of the span that caused them, and process ID's (normally IP address).

Spans are started and stopped, and they keep track of their timing information.  Once you create a
span, you must stop it at some point in the future.

TIP: The initial span that starts a trace is called a `root span`. The value of span id
of that span is equal to trace id.

*Trace:* A set of spans forming a tree-like structure.  For example, if you are running a distributed
big-data store, a trace might be formed by a put request.

*Annotation:*  is used to record existence of an event in time. Some of the core annotations used to define
the start and stop of a request are:

    - *cs* - Client Sent - The client has made a request. This annotation depicts the start of the span.
    - *sr* - Server Received -  The server side got the request and will start processing it.
    If one subtracts the cs timestamp from this timestamp one will receive the network latency.
    - *ss* - Server Sent -  Annotated upon completion of request processing (when the response
    got sent back to the client). If one subtracts the sr timestamp from this timestamp one
    will receive the time needed by the server side to process the request.
    - *cr* - Client Received - Signifies the end of the span. The client has successfully received the
    response from the server side. If one subtracts the cs timestamp from this timestamp one
    will receive the whole time needed by the client to receive the response from the server.

Visualization of what *Span* and *Trace* will look in a system together with the Zipkin annotations:

image::{github-raw}/docs/src/main/asciidoc/images/trace-id.png[Trace Info propagation]

Each color of a note signifies a span (7 spans - from *A* to *G*). If you have such information in the note:

[source]
Trace Id = X
Span Id = D
Client Sent

That means that the current span has *Trace-Id* set to *X*, *Span-Id* set to *D*. It also has emitted
 *Client Sent* event.

This is how the visualization of the parent / child relationship of spans would look like:

image::{github-raw}/docs/src/main/asciidoc/images/parents.png[Parent child relationship]

=== Purpose

In the following sections the example from the image above will be taken into consideration.

==== Distributed tracing with Zipkin

Altogether there are *10 spans* . If you go to traces in Zipkin you will see this number:

image::{github-raw}/docs/src/main/asciidoc/images/zipkin-traces.png[Traces]

However if you pick a particular trace then you will see *7 spans*:

image::{github-raw}/docs/src/main/asciidoc/images/zipkin-ui.png[Traces Info propagation]

NOTE: When picking a particular trace you will see merged spans. That means that if there were 2 spans sent to
Zipkin with Server Received and Server Sent / Client Received and Client Sent
annotations then they will presented as a single span.

In the image depicting the visualization of what *Span* and *Trace* is you can see 20
colorful labels. How does it happen that in Zipkin 10 spans are received?

    - 2 span *A* labels signify span started and closed. Upon closing a single span is sent to Zipkin.
    - 4 span *B* labels are in fact are single span with 4 annotations. However this span is composed of
        two separate instances. One sent from service 1 and one from service 2. So in fact two span instances will be sent
        to Zipkin and merged there.
    - 2 span *C* labels signify span started and closed. Upon closing a single span is sent to Zipkin.
    - 4 span *B* labels are in fact are single span with 4 annotations. However this span is composed of
        two separate instances. One sent from service 2 and one from service 3. So in fact two span instances will be sent
        to Zipkin and merged there.
    - 2 span *E* labels signify span started and closed. Upon closing a single span is sent to Zipkin.
    - 4 span *B* labels are in fact are single span with 4 annotations. However this span is composed of
        two separate instances. One sent from service 2 and one from service 4. So in fact two span instances will be sent
        to Zipkin and merged there.
    - 2 span *G* labels signify span started and closed. Upon closing a single span is sent to Zipkin.

So 1 span from *A*, 2 spans from *B*, 1 span from *C*, 2 spans from *D*, 1 span from *E*, 2 spans from *F* and 1 from *G*.
Altogether *10* spans.

==== Log correlation

When grepping the logs of those four applications by trace id equal to e.g. `2485ec27856c56f4` one would get the following:

[source]

If you're using a log aggregating tool like https://www.elastic.co/products/kibana[Kibana],
http://www.splunk.com/[Splunk] etc. you can order the events that took place. An example of
Kibana would look like this:

image::{github-raw}/docs/src/main/asciidoc/images/kibana.png[Log correlation with Kibana]

If you want to use https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/index.html[Logstash] here is the Grok pattern for Logstash:

[source]
filter {
       # pattern matching logback pattern
       grok {
              match => { "message" => "%{TIMESTAMP_ISO8601:timestamp}\s+%{LOGLEVEL:severity}\s+\[%{DATA:service},%{DATA:trace},%{DATA:span},%{DATA:exportable}\]\s+%{DATA:pid}---\s+\[%{DATA:thread}\]\s+%{DATA:class}\s+:\s+%{GREEDYDATA:rest}" }
       }
}

NOTE: If you want to use Grok together with the logs from Cloud Foundry you have to use this pattern:
[source]
filter {
       # pattern matching logback pattern
       grok {
              match => { "message" => "(?m)OUT\s+%{TIMESTAMP_ISO8601:timestamp}\s+%{LOGLEVEL:severity}\s+\[%{DATA:service},%{DATA:trace},%{DATA:span},%{DATA:exportable}\]\s+%{DATA:pid}---\s+\[%{DATA:thread}\]\s+%{DATA:class}\s+:\s+%{GREEDYDATA:rest}" }
       }
}

===== JSON Logback with Logstash

Often you do not want to store your logs in a text file but in a JSON file that Logstash can immediately pick. To do that you have to do the following (for readability
we're passing the dependencies in the `groupId:artifactId:version` notation.

*Dependencies setup*

- Ensure that Logback is on the classpath (`ch.qos.logback:logback-core`)
- Add Logstash Logback encode - example for version `4.6` : `net.logstash.logback:logstash-logback-encoder:4.6`

*Logback setup*

Below you can find an example of a Logback configuration (file named `https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/sleuth-documentation-apps/blob/master/service1/src/main/resources/logback-spring.xml[logback-spring.xml]`) that:

- logs information from the application in a JSON format to a `build/${spring.application.name}.json` file
- has commented out two additional appenders - console and standard log file
- has the same logging pattern as the one presented in the previous section

[source,xml]
-----
include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-cloud-samples/sleuth-documentation-apps/master/service1/src/main/resources/logback-spring.xml[]
-----

NOTE: If you're using a custom `logback-spring.xml` then you have to pass the `spring.application.name` in
`bootstrap` instead of `application` property file. Otherwise your custom logback file won't read the property properly.

==== Propagating Span Context

The span context is the state that must get propagated to any child Spans across process boundaries.
Part of the Span Context is the Baggage. The trace and span IDs are a required part of the span context.
Baggage is an optional part.

Baggage is a set of key:value pairs stored in the span context. Baggage travels together with the trace
and is attached to every span. Spring Cloud Sleuth will understand that a header is baggage related if the HTTP
 header is prefixed with `baggage-` and for messaging it starts with `baggage_`.

IMPORTANT: There's currently no limitation of the count or size of baggage items. However, keep in mind that
too many can decrease system throughput or increase RPC latency. In extreme cases, it could crash the app due
to exceeding transport-level message or header capacity.

Example of setting baggage on a span:

[source,java]
----
include::{github-raw}/spring-cloud-sleuth-core/src/test/java/org/springframework/cloud/sleuth/instrument/web/multiple/MultipleHopsIntegrationTests.java[tags=baggage,indent=0]
----

===== Baggage vs. Span Tags

Baggage travels with the trace (i.e. every child span contains the baggage of its parent). Zipkin has no knowledge of
baggage and will not even receive that information.

Tags are attached to a specific span - they are presented for that particular span only. However you
can search by tag to find the trace, where there exists a span having the searched tag value.

If you want to be able to lookup a span based on baggage, you should add corresponding entry as a tag in the root span.

[source,java]
----
@Autowired Tracer tracer;

Span span = tracer.getCurrentSpan();
String baggageKey = "key";
String baggageValue = "foo";
span.setBaggageItem(baggageKey, baggageValue);
tracer.addTag(baggageKey, baggageValue);

=== Adding to the project

==== Only Sleuth (log correlation)

If you want to profit only from Spring Cloud Sleuth without the Zipkin integration just add
the `spring-cloud-starter-sleuth` module to your project.
