[[sleuth-integration]]
= Spring Cloud Sleuth customization

include::_attributes.adoc[]

In this section, we describe how to customize various parts of Spring Cloud Sleuth.

[[sleuth-async-integration]]
== Asynchronous Communication

In this section, we describe how to customize asynchronous communication with Spring Cloud Sleuth.

[[sleuth-async-annotation-integration]]
=== `@Async` Annotated methods

This feature is available for both Brave and OpenTelemetry tracer implementation.

In Spring Cloud Sleuth, we instrument async-related components so that the tracing information is passed between threads.
You can disable this behavior by setting the value of `spring.sleuth.async.enabled` to `false`.

If you annotate your method with `@Async`, we automatically create a new Span with the following characteristics:

* If the method is annotated with `@SpanName`, the value of the annotation is the Span's name.
* If the method is not annotated with `@SpanName`, the Span name is the annotated method name.
* The span is tagged with the method's class name and method name.

[[sleuth-async-scheduled-integration]]
=== `@Scheduled` Annotated Methods

This feature is available for both Brave and OpenTelemetry tracer implementation.

In Spring Cloud Sleuth, we instrument scheduled method execution so that the tracing information is passed between threads.
You can disable this behavior by setting the value of `spring.sleuth.scheduled.enabled` to `false`.

If you annotate your method with `@Scheduled`, we automatically create a new span with the following characteristics:

* The span name is the annotated method name.
* The span is tagged with the method's class name and method name.

If you want to skip span creation for some `@Scheduled` annotated classes, you can set the `spring.sleuth.scheduled.skipPattern` with a regular expression that matches the fully qualified name of the `@Scheduled` annotated class.

[[sleuth-async-executor-service-integration]]
=== Executor, ExecutorService, and ScheduledExecutorService

This feature is available for both Brave and OpenTelemetry tracer implementation.

We provide `LazyTraceExecutor`, `TraceableExecutorService`, and `TraceableScheduledExecutorService`.
Those implementations create spans each time a new task is submitted, invoked, or scheduled.

The following example shows how to pass tracing information with `TraceableExecutorService` when working with `CompletableFuture`:

[source,java,indent=0]
----

include::{common_tests_path}/src/main/java/org/springframework/cloud/sleuth/instrument/async/TraceableExecutorServiceTests.java[tags=completablefuture,indent=0]
----

IMPORTANT: Sleuth does not work with `parallelStream()` out of the box.
If you want to have the tracing information propagated through the stream, you have to use the approach with `supplyAsync(...)`, as shown earlier.

If there are beans that implement the `Executor` interface that you would like to exclude from span creation, you can use the `spring.sleuth.async.ignored-beans`
property where you can provide a list of bean names.

You can disable this behavior by setting the value of `spring.sleuth.async.enabled` to `false`.

[[sleuth-async-executor-integration]]
==== Customization of Executors

Sometimes, you need to set up a custom instance of the `AsyncExecutor`.
The following example shows how to set up such a custom `Executor`:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{common_tests_path}/src/main/java/org/springframework/cloud/sleuth/instrument/web/client/MultipleAsyncRestTemplateTests.java[tags=custom_executor,indent=0]
----

TIP: To ensure that your configuration gets post processed, remember to add the `@Role(BeanDefinition.ROLE_INFRASTRUCTURE)` on your
`@Configuration` class

[[sleuth-http-client-integration]]
== HTTP Client Integration

Features from this section can be disabled by setting the `spring.sleuth.web.client.enabled` property with value equal to `false`.

[[sleuth-http-client-rest-template-integration]]
=== Synchronous Rest Template

This feature is available for both Brave and OpenTelemetry tracer implementation.

We inject a `RestTemplate` interceptor to ensure that all the tracing information is passed to the requests.
Each time a call is made, a new Span is created.
It gets closed upon receiving the response.
To block the synchronous `RestTemplate` features, set `spring.sleuth.web.client.enabled` to `false`.

IMPORTANT: You have to register `RestTemplate` as a bean so that the interceptors get injected.
If you create a `RestTemplate` instance with a `new` keyword, the instrumentation does NOT work.

[[sleuth-http-client-async-rest-template-integration]]
=== Asynchronous Rest Template

This feature is available for both Brave and OpenTelemetry tracer implementation.

IMPORTANT: Starting with Sleuth `2.0.0`, we no longer register a bean of `AsyncRestTemplate` type.
It is up to you to create such a bean.
Then we instrument it.

To block the `AsyncRestTemplate` features, set `spring.sleuth.web.async.client.enabled` to `false`.
To disable creation of the default `TraceAsyncClientHttpRequestFactoryWrapper`, set `spring.sleuth.web.async.client.factory.enabled`
to `false`.
If you do not want to create `AsyncRestClient` at all, set `spring.sleuth.web.async.client.template.enabled` to `false`.

[[sleuth-http-client-multiple-async-rest-template-integration]]
==== Multiple Asynchronous Rest Templates

Sometimes you need to use multiple implementations of the Asynchronous Rest Template.
In the following snippet, you can see an example of how to set up such a custom `AsyncRestTemplate`:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{common_tests_path}/src/main/java/org/springframework/cloud/sleuth/instrument/web/client/MultipleAsyncRestTemplateTests.java[tags=custom_async_rest_template,indent=0]
----

[[sleuth-http-client-webclient-integration]]
==== `WebClient`

This feature is available for both Brave and OpenTelemetry tracer implementation.

We inject a `ExchangeFilterFunction` implementation that creates a span and, through on-success and on-error callbacks, takes care of closing client-side spans.

To block this feature, set `spring.sleuth.web.client.enabled` to `false`.

IMPORTANT: You have to register `WebClient` as a bean so that the tracing instrumentation gets applied.
If you create a `WebClient` instance with a `new` keyword, the instrumentation does NOT work.

[[sleuth-http-client-traverson-integration]]
==== Traverson

This feature is available for both Brave and OpenTelemetry tracer implementation.

If you use the https://docs.spring.io/spring-hateoas/docs/current/reference/html/#client.traverson[Traverson] library, you can inject a `RestTemplate` as a bean into your Traverson object.
Since `RestTemplate` is already intercepted, you get full support for tracing in your client.
The following pseudo code shows how to do that:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
@Autowired RestTemplate restTemplate;

Traverson traverson = new Traverson(URI.create("https://some/address"),
    MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON, MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON_UTF8).setRestOperations(restTemplate);
// use Traverson
----

[[sleuth-http-client-apache-integration]]
==== Apache `HttpClientBuilder` and `HttpAsyncClientBuilder`

This feature is available for Brave tracer implementation.

We instrument the `HttpClientBuilder` and `HttpAsyncClientBuilder` so that tracing context gets injected to the sent requests.

To block these features, set `spring.sleuth.web.client.enabled` to `false`.

[[sleuth-http-client-netty-integration]]
==== Netty `HttpClient`

This feature is available for both Brave and OpenTelemetry tracer implementation.

We instrument the Netty's `HttpClient`.

To block this feature, set `spring.sleuth.web.client.enabled` to `false`.

IMPORTANT: You have to register `HttpClient` as a bean so that the instrumentation happens.
If you create a `HttpClient` instance with a `new` keyword, the instrumentation does NOT work.

[[sleuth-http-client-userinfo-integration]]
==== `UserInfoRestTemplateCustomizer`

This feature is available for both Brave and OpenTelemetry tracer implementation.

We instrument the Spring Security's `UserInfoRestTemplateCustomizer`.

To block this feature, set `spring.sleuth.web.client.enabled` to `false`.

[[sleuth-http-server-integration]]
== HTTP Server Integration

Features from this section can be disabled by setting the `spring.sleuth.web.enabled` property with value equal to `false`.

[[sleuth-http-server-http-filter-integration]]
=== HTTP Filter

This feature is available for both Brave and OpenTelemetry tracer implementation.

Through the `TracingFilter`, all sampled incoming requests result in creation of a Span.
You can configure which URIs you would like to skip by setting the `spring.sleuth.web.skipPattern` property.
If you have `ManagementServerProperties` on classpath, its value of `contextPath` gets appended to the provided skip pattern.
If you want to reuse the Sleuth's default skip patterns and just append your own, pass those patterns by using the `spring.sleuth.web.additionalSkipPattern`.

By default, all the spring boot actuator endpoints are automatically added to the skip pattern.
If you want to disable this behaviour set `spring.sleuth.web.ignore-auto-configured-skip-patterns`
to `true`.

To change the order of tracing filter registration, please set the
`spring.sleuth.web.filter-order` property.

To disable the filter that logs uncaught exceptions you can disable the
`spring.sleuth.web.exception-throwing-filter-enabled` property.

[[sleuth-http-server-handler-interceptor-integration]]
=== HandlerInterceptor

This feature is available for both Brave and OpenTelemetry tracer implementation.

Since we want the span names to be precise, we use a `TraceHandlerInterceptor` that either wraps an existing `HandlerInterceptor` or is added directly to the list of existing `HandlerInterceptors`.
The `TraceHandlerInterceptor` adds a special request attribute to the given `HttpServletRequest`.
If the the `TracingFilter` does not see this attribute, it creates a "`fallback`" span, which is an additional span created on the server side so that the trace is presented properly in the UI.
If that happens, there is probably missing instrumentation.
In that case, please file an issue in Spring Cloud Sleuth.

[[sleuth-http-server-async-integration]]
=== Async Servlet support

This feature is available for both Brave and OpenTelemetry tracer implementation.

If your controller returns a `Callable` or a `WebAsyncTask`, Spring Cloud Sleuth continues the existing span instead of creating a new one.

[[sleuth-http-server-webflux-integration]]
=== WebFlux support

This feature is available for both Brave and OpenTelemetry tracer implementation.

Through `TraceWebFilter`, all sampled incoming requests result in creation of a Span.
That Span's name is `http:` + the path to which the request was sent.
For example, if the request was sent to `/this/that`, the name is `http:/this/that`.
You can configure which URIs you would like to skip by using the `spring.sleuth.web.skipPattern` property.
If you have `ManagementServerProperties` on the classpath, its value of `contextPath` gets appended to the provided skip pattern.
If you want to reuse Sleuth's default skip patterns and append your own, pass those patterns by using the `spring.sleuth.web.additionalSkipPattern`.

In order to achieve best results in terms of performance and context propagation we suggest that you switch the `spring.sleuth.reactor.instrumentation-type` to `MANUAL`.
In order to execute code with the span in scope you can call `WebFluxSleuthOperators.withSpanInScope`.
Example:

[source,java,indent=0]
-----
include::{project-root}/benchmarks/src/main/java/org/springframework/cloud/sleuth/benchmarks/app/webflux/SleuthBenchmarkingSpringWebFluxApp.java[tags=simple_manual,indent=0]
-----

To change the order of tracing filter registration, please set the
`spring.sleuth.web.filter-order` property.

[[sleuth-messaging-integration]]
== Messaging

Features from this section can be disabled by setting the `spring.sleuth.messaging.enabled` property with value equal to `false`.

[[sleuth-messaging-spring-integration-integration]]
=== Spring Integration

This feature is available for both Brave and OpenTelemetry tracer implementation.

Spring Cloud Sleuth integrates with https://projects.spring.io/spring-integration/[Spring Integration].
It creates spans for publish and subscribe events.
To disable Spring Integration instrumentation, set `spring.sleuth.integration.enabled` to `false`.

You can provide the `spring.sleuth.integration.patterns` pattern to explicitly provide the names of channels that you want to include for tracing.
By default, all channels but `hystrixStreamOutput` channel are included.

IMPORTANT: When using the `Executor` to build a Spring Integration `IntegrationFlow`, you must use the untraced version of the `Executor`.
Decorating the Spring Integration Executor Channel with `TraceableExecutorService` causes the spans to be improperly closed.

If you want to customize the way tracing context is read from and written to message headers, it's enough for you to register beans of types:

* `Propagator.Setter<MessageHeaderAccessor>` - for writing headers to the message
* `Propagator.Getter<MessageHeaderAccessor>` - for reading headers from the message

[[sleuth-messaging-spring-cloud-function-integration]]
=== Spring Cloud Function and Spring Cloud Stream

This feature is available for both Brave and OpenTelemetry tracer implementation.

Spring Cloud Sleuth can instrument Spring Cloud Function.
The way to achieve it is to provide a `Function` or `Consumer` or `Supplier` that takes in a `Message` as a parameter e.g. `Function<Message<String>, Message<Integer>>`.
If the type is not `Message` then instrumentation will not take place.
Out of the box instrumentation will not take place when dealing with Reactor based streams - e.g. `Function<Flux<Message<String>>, Flux<Message<Integer>>>`.

Since Spring Cloud Stream reuses Spring Cloud Function, you'll get the instrumentation out of the box.

You can disable this behavior by setting the value of `spring.sleuth.function.enabled` to `false`.

In order to work with reactive Stream functions you can leverage the `MessagingSleuthOperators` utility class that allows you to manipulate the input and output messages in order to continue the tracing context and to execute custom code within the tracing context.

[source,java,indent=0]
-----
include::{project-root}/benchmarks/src/main/java/org/springframework/cloud/sleuth/benchmarks/app/stream/SleuthBenchmarkingStreamApplication.java[tags=simple_reactive,indent=0]
-----

[[sleuth-messaging-spring-rabbitmq-integration]]
=== Spring RabbitMq

This feature is available for Brave tracer implementation.

We instrument the `RabbitTemplate` so that tracing headers get injected into the message.

To block this feature, set `spring.sleuth.messaging.rabbit.enabled` to `false`.

[[sleuth-messaging-spring-kafka-integration]]
=== Spring Kafka

This feature is available for Brave tracer implementation.

We instrument the Spring Kafka's `ProducerFactory` and `ConsumerFactory`
so that tracing headers get injected into the created Spring Kafka's
`Producer` and `Consumer`.

To block this feature, set `spring.sleuth.messaging.kafka.enabled` to `false`.

[[sleuth-messaging-spring-kafka-streams-integration]]
=== Spring Kafka Streams

This feature is available for Brave tracer implementation.

We instrument the `KafkaStreams` `KafkaClientSupplier` so that tracing headers get injected into the `Producer` and `Consumer`s. A `KafkaStreamsTracing` bean allows for further instrumentation through additional `TransformerSupplier` and
`ProcessorSupplier` methods.

To block this feature, set `spring.sleuth.messaging.kafka.streams.enabled` to `false`.

[[sleuth-messaging-spring-jms-integration]]
=== Spring JMS

This feature is available for Brave tracer implementation.

We instrument the `JmsTemplate` so that tracing headers get injected into the message.
We also support `@JmsListener` annotated methods on the consumer side.

To block this feature, set `spring.sleuth.messaging.jms.enabled` to `false`.

IMPORTANT: We don't support baggage propagation for JMS

[[sleuth-openfeign-integration]]
== OpenFeign

This feature is available for both Brave and OpenTelemetry tracer implementation.

By default, Spring Cloud Sleuth provides integration with Feign through `TraceFeignClientAutoConfiguration`.
You can disable it entirely by setting `spring.sleuth.feign.enabled` to `false`.
If you do so, no Feign-related instrumentation take place.

Part of Feign instrumentation is done through a `FeignBeanPostProcessor`.
You can disable it by setting `spring.sleuth.feign.processor.enabled` to `false`.
If you set it to `false`, Spring Cloud Sleuth does not instrument any of your custom Feign components.
However, all the default instrumentation is still there.

[[sleuth-opentracing-integration]]
== OpenTracing

This feature is available for both Brave and OpenTelemetry tracer implementation.

Spring Cloud Sleuth is compatible with https://opentracing.io/[OpenTracing].
If you have OpenTracing on the classpath, we automatically register the OpenTracing `Tracer` bean.
If you wish to disable this, set `spring.sleuth.opentracing.enabled` to `false`

[[sleuth-quartz-integration]]
== Quartz

This feature is available for both Brave and OpenTelemetry tracer implementation.

We instrument quartz jobs by adding Job/Trigger listeners to the Quartz Scheduler.

To turn off this feature, set the `spring.sleuth.quartz.enabled` property to `false`.

[[sleuth-reactor-integration]]
== Reactor

This feature is available for both Brave and OpenTelemetry tracer implementation.

We have three modes of instrumenting reactor based applications that can be set via `spring.sleuth.reactor.instrumentation-type` property:

* `ON_EACH` - wraps every Reactor operator in a trace representation.
Passes the tracing context in most cases.
This mode might lead to drastic performance degradation.
* `ON_LAST` - wraps last Reactor operator in a trace representation.
Passes the tracing context in some cases thus accessing MDC context might not work.
This mode might lead to medium performance degradation.
* `MANUAL` - wraps every Reactor in the least invasive way without passing of tracing context.
It's up to the user to do it.

Current default is `ON_EACH` for backward compatibility reasons, however we encourage the users to migrate to the `MANUAL` instrumentation and profit from `WebFluxSleuthOperators` and `MessagingSleuthOperators`.
The performance improvement can be substantial.
Example:

[source,java,indent=0]
-----
include::{project-root}/benchmarks/src/main/java/org/springframework/cloud/sleuth/benchmarks/app/webflux/SleuthBenchmarkingSpringWebFluxApp.java[tags=simple_manual,indent=0]
-----

[[sleuth-redis-integration]]
== Redis

This feature is available for Brave tracer implementation.

We set `tracing` property to Lettuce `ClientResources` instance to enable Brave tracing built in Lettuce .
To disable Redis support, set the `spring.sleuth.redis.enabled` property to `false`.

[[sleuth-runnablecallable-integration]]
== Runnable and Callable

This feature is available for both Brave and OpenTelemetry tracer implementation.

If you wrap your logic in `Runnable` or `Callable`, you can wrap those classes in their Sleuth representative, as shown in the following example for `Runnable`:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{brave_path}/src/test/java/org/springframework/cloud/sleuth/brave/SpringCloudSleuthDocTests.java[tags=trace_runnable,indent=0]
----

The following example shows how to do so for `Callable`:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{brave_path}/src/test/java/org/springframework/cloud/sleuth/brave/SpringCloudSleuthDocTests.java[tags=trace_callable,indent=0]
----

That way, you ensure that a new span is created and closed for each execution.

[[sleuth-rpc-integration]]
== RPC

This feature is available for Brave tracer implementation.

Sleuth automatically configures the `RpcTracing` bean which serves as a foundation for RPC instrumentation such as gRPC or Dubbo.

If a customization of client / server sampling of the RPC traces is required, just register a bean of type `brave.sampler.SamplerFunction<RpcRequest>` and name the bean `sleuthRpcClientSampler` for client sampler and
`sleuthRpcServerSampler` for server sampler.

For your convenience the `@RpcClientSampler` and `@RpcServerSampler`
annotations can be used to inject the proper beans or to reference the bean names via their static String `NAME` fields.

Ex.
Here's a sampler that traces 100 "GetUserToken" server requests per second.
This doesn't start new traces for requests to the health check service.
Other requests will use the global sampling configuration.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
@Configuration(proxyBeanMethods = false)
	class Config {
include::{autoconfig_path}/src/test/java/org/springframework/cloud/sleuth/autoconfig/brave/instrument/rpc/BraveRpcAutoConfigurationIntegrationTests.java[tags=custom_rpc_server_sampler,indent=2]
}
----

For more, see https://github.com/openzipkin/brave/tree/master/instrumentation/rpc#sampling-policy

[[sleuth-rpc-dubbo-integration]]
=== Dubbo RPC support

Via the integration with Brave, Spring Cloud Sleuth supports https://dubbo.apache.org/[Dubbo].
It's enough to add the `brave-instrumentation-dubbo` dependency:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.zipkin.brave</groupId>
    <artifactId>brave-instrumentation-dubbo</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

You need to also set a `dubbo.properties` file with the following contents:

```properties
dubbo.provider.filter=tracing
dubbo.consumer.filter=tracing
```

You can read more about Brave - Dubbo integration https://github.com/openzipkin/brave/tree/master/instrumentation/dubbo-rpc[here].
An example of Spring Cloud Sleuth and Dubbo can be found https://github.com/openzipkin/sleuth-webmvc-example/compare/add-dubbo-tracing[here].

[[sleuth-rpc-grpc-integration]]
=== gRPC

Spring Cloud Sleuth provides instrumentation for https://grpc.io/[gRPC] via the Brave tracer.
You can disable it entirely by setting `spring.sleuth.grpc.enabled` to `false`.

[[sleuth-rpc-grpc-variant1-integration]]
==== Variant 1

[[sleuth-rpc-grpc-variant1-dependencies-integration]]
===== Dependencies

IMPORTANT: The gRPC integration relies on two external libraries to instrument clients and servers and both of those libraries must be on the class path to enable the instrumentation.

Maven:

```
		<dependency>
			<groupId>io.github.lognet</groupId>
			<artifactId>grpc-spring-boot-starter</artifactId>
		</dependency>
		<dependency>
			<groupId>io.zipkin.brave</groupId>
			<artifactId>brave-instrumentation-grpc</artifactId>
		</dependency>
```

Gradle:

```
    compile("io.github.lognet:grpc-spring-boot-starter")
    compile("io.zipkin.brave:brave-instrumentation-grpc")
```

[[sleuth-rpc-grpc-variant1-server-integration]]
===== Server Instrumentation

Spring Cloud Sleuth leverages grpc-spring-boot-starter to register Brave's gRPC server interceptor with all services annotated with `@GRpcService`.

[[sleuth-rpc-grpc-variant1-client-integration]]
===== Client Instrumentation

gRPC clients leverage a `ManagedChannelBuilder` to construct a `ManagedChannel` used to communicate to the gRPC server.
The native `ManagedChannelBuilder` provides static methods as entry points for construction of `ManagedChannel` instances, however, this mechanism is outside the influence of the Spring application context.

IMPORTANT: Spring Cloud Sleuth provides a `SpringAwareManagedChannelBuilder` that can be customized through the Spring application context and injected by gRPC clients.
*This builder must be used when creating `ManagedChannel` instances.*

Sleuth creates a `TracingManagedChannelBuilderCustomizer` which inject Brave's client interceptor into the `SpringAwareManagedChannelBuilder`.

[[sleuth-rpc-grpc-variant2-integration]]
==== Variant 2

https://github.com/yidongnan/grpc-spring-boot-starter[Grpc Spring Boot Starter] automatically detects the presence of Spring Cloud Sleuth and Brave's instrumentation for gRPC and registers the necessary client and/or server tooling.

[[sleuth-rxjava-integration]]
== RxJava

This feature is available for both Brave and OpenTelemetry tracer implementation.

We registering a custom https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava/wiki/Plugins#rxjavaschedulershook[`RxJavaSchedulersHook`] that wraps all `Action0` instances in their Sleuth representative, which is called `TraceAction`.
The hook either starts or continues a span, depending on whether tracing was already going on before the Action was scheduled.
To disable the custom `RxJavaSchedulersHook`, set the `spring.sleuth.rxjava.schedulers.hook.enabled` to `false`.

You can define a list of regular expressions for thread names for which you do not want spans to be created.
To do so, provide a comma-separated list of regular expressions in the `spring.sleuth.rxjava.schedulers.ignoredthreads` property.

IMPORTANT: The suggested approach to reactive programming and Sleuth is to use the Reactor support.

[[sleuth-circuitbreaker-integration]]
== Spring Cloud CircuitBreaker

This feature is available for both Brave and OpenTelemetry tracer implementation.

If you have Spring Cloud CircuitBreaker on the classpath, we will wrap the passed command `Supplier` and the fallback `Function` in its trace representations.
In order to disable this instrumentation set `spring.sleuth.circuitbreaker.enabled` to `false`.
