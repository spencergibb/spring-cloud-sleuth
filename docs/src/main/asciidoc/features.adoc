=== Features
Sleuth sets up instrumentation not only to track timing, but also to catch
errors so that they can be analyzed or correlated with logs. This works the
same way regardless of if the error came from a common instrumented library,
such as `RestTemplate`, or your own code annotated with `@NewSpan` or similar.

Below, we'll use the word Zipkin to describe the tracing system, and include
Zipkin screenshots. However, most services accepting Zipkin's format[https://zipkin.io/zipkin-api/#/default/post_spans],
have similar base features. Sleuth can also be configured to send data in other
formats, something detailed later.

==== Contextualizing errors
Without distributed tracing, it can be difficult to understand the impact of a
an exception. For example, it can be hard to know if a specific request caused
the caller to fail or not.

Zipkin reduces time in triage by contextualizing errors and delays.

Requests colored red in the search screen failed:

If you then click on one of the traces, you can understand if the failure
happened before the request hit another service or not:

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-sleuth/{branch}/docs/src/main/asciidoc/images/zipkin-error-trace-screenshot.png[Error Traces Info propagation]

For example, the above error happened in the "backend" service, and caused the
"frontend" service to fail.

==== Log correlation
Sleuth configures the logging context with variables including the service name
(`%{spring.zipkin.service.name}`) and the trace ID (`%{traceId}`). These help
you connect logs with distributed traces and allow you choice in what tools you
use to troubleshoot your services.

Once you find any log with an error, you can look for the trace ID in the
message. Paste that into Zipkin to visualize the entire trace, regardless of
how many services the first request ended up hitting.

backend.log:  2020-04-09 17:45:40.516 ERROR [backend,5e8eeec48b08e26882aba313eb08f0a4,dcc1df555b5777b3,true] 97203 --- [nio-9000-exec-1] o.s.c.s.i.web.ExceptionLoggingFilter     : Uncaught exception thrown
frontend.log:2020-04-09 17:45:40.574 ERROR [frontend,5e8eeec48b08e26882aba313eb08f0a4,82aba313eb08f0a4,true] 97192 --- [nio-8081-exec-2] o.s.c.s.i.web.ExceptionLoggingFilter     : Uncaught exception thrown

Above, you'll notice the trace ID is `5e8eeec48b08e26882aba313eb08f0a4`, for
example. This log configuration was automatically setup by Sleuth.

If you use a log aggregating tool (such as https://www.elastic.co/products/kibana[Kibana], https://www.splunk.com/[Splunk], and others), you can order the events that took place.
An example from Kibana would resemble the following image:

If you want to use https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/index.html[Logstash], the following listing shows the Grok pattern for Logstash:

[source]
filter {
  # pattern matching logback pattern
  grok {
    match => { "message" => "%{TIMESTAMP_ISO8601:timestamp}\s+%{LOGLEVEL:severity}\s+\[%{DATA:service},%{DATA:trace},%{DATA:span}\]\s+%{DATA:pid}\s+---\s+\[%{DATA:thread}\]\s+%{DATA:class}\s+:\s+%{GREEDYDATA:rest}" }
  }
  date {
    match => ["timestamp", "ISO8601"]
  }
  mutate {
    remove_field => ["timestamp"]
  }
}

NOTE: If you want to use Grok together with the logs from Cloud Foundry, you have to use the following pattern:
[source]
filter {
  # pattern matching logback pattern
  grok {
    match => { "message" => "(?m)OUT\s+%{TIMESTAMP_ISO8601:timestamp}\s+%{LOGLEVEL:severity}\s+\[%{DATA:service},%{DATA:trace},%{DATA:span}\]\s+%{DATA:pid}\s+---\s+\[%{DATA:thread}\]\s+%{DATA:class}\s+:\s+%{GREEDYDATA:rest}" }
  }
  date {
    match => ["timestamp", "ISO8601"]
  }
  mutate {
    remove_field => ["timestamp"]
  }
}

===== JSON Logback with Logstash

Often, you do not want to store your logs in a text file but in a JSON file that Logstash can immediately pick.
To do so, you have to do the following (for readability, we pass the dependencies in the `groupId:artifactId:version` notation).

*Dependencies Setup*

. Ensure that Logback is on the classpath (`ch.qos.logback:logback-core`).
. Add Logstash Logback encode. For example, to use version `4.6`, add `net.logstash.logback:logstash-logback-encoder:4.6`.

*Logback Setup*

Consider the following example of a Logback configuration file (named https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/sleuth-documentation-apps/blob/master/service1/src/main/resources/logback-spring.xml[logback-spring.xml]).

[source,xml]
-----
include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-cloud-samples/sleuth-documentation-apps/master/service1/src/main/resources/logback-spring.xml[]
-----

That Logback configuration file:

* Logs information from the application in a JSON format to a `build/${spring.application.name}.json` file.
* Has commented out two additional appenders: console and standard log file.
* Has the same logging pattern as the one presented in the previous section.

NOTE: If you use a custom `logback-spring.xml`, you must pass the `spring.application.name` in the  `bootstrap` rather than the `application` property file.
Otherwise, your custom logback file does not properly read the property.

==== Service Dependency Graph
When you consider distributed tracing tracks requests, it makes sense that
trace data can paint a picture of your architecture.

Zipkin includes a tool to build service dependency diagrams from traces,
including the count of calls and how many errors exist.

The example application will make a simple diagram like this, but your real
environment diagram may be more complex.
image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-sleuth/{branch}/docs/src/main/asciidoc/images/zipkin-depedendencies.png[Zipkin Dependencies]

*Note*: Production environments will generate a lot of data. You will likely
need to run a separate service to aggregate the dependency graph. You can learn
more https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-dependencies/[here].

==== Request scoped properties (Baggage)
Distributed tracing works by propagating fields inside and across services that
connect the trace together: traceId and spanId notably. The context that holds
these fields can optionally push other fields that need to be consistent
regardless of many services are touched. The simple name for these extra fields
is "Baggage".

Sleuth allows you to define which baggage are permitted to exist in the trace
context, including what header names are used.

The following example shows setting baggage values:

[source,java]
----
include::{project-root}/spring-cloud-sleuth-core/src/test/java/org/springframework/cloud/sleuth/instrument/multiple/MultipleHopsIntegrationTests.java[tags=baggage,indent=0]
----

IMPORTANT: There is currently no limitation of the count or size of baggage
items. Keep in mind that too many can decrease system throughput or increase
RPC latency. In extreme cases, too much baggage can crash the application, due
to exceeding transport-level message or header capacity.


===== Baggage versus Tags

Like trace IDs, Baggage is attached to messages or requests, usually as
headers. Tags are key value pairs sent in a Span to Zipkin. Baggage values are
not added spans by default, which means you can't search based on Baggage
unless  you opt-in.

To make baggage also tags, use the property `spring.sleuth.baggage.tag-fields`
like so:
[source,yml]
----
include::{project-root}/spring-cloud-sleuth-core/src/test/resources/application-baggage.yml[indent=0]
----
